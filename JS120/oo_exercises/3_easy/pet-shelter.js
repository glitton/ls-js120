/* Write the classes and methods that will be necessary to make this code run, and log the following output:

- Three Classes: Pet, Owner, and Shelter
The Pet class should have properties like animal (the type of pet) and name (the pet's name), and it typically includes a method like info() that returns a descriptive string.

The Owner class should hold the owner's name and also keep track of the pets they have adopted, usually with an array of Pet objects. It also needs methods like addPet() to add a pet to their list, and numberOfPets() to return how many pets they have.

The Shelter class generally keeps track of owners (not just names) and facilitates the adoption process via the adopt() method, which takes Owner and Pet objectsâ€”not just their names. It also needs a method like printAdoptions() to display adoption records.
