Step 1: Write a textual description of the problem or exercise.
RPS is a two-player game where each player chooses one of three possible moves: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is chosen by comparing their moves with the following rules:

- Rock crushes scissors, i.e., rock wins against scissors.
- Scissors cuts paper, i.e., scissors beats paper.
- Paper wraps rock, i.e., paper beats rock.

If the players chose the same move, the game is a tie.

Nouns: player, move, rule
Verbs: choose, compare

Step 3: Organize and associate the verbs with the nouns.
