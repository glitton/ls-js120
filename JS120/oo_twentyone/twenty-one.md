- Twenty-One is a card game with a dealer and a player.
- The participants try to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.
- The game starts by dealing cards from a 52-card deck consisting of cards from 4 suits of 13 ranks each.
- Both participants receive two cards.
  -- The dealer hides one of his cards (places it face-down) so that the player can't see what it is.
  -- The player can see both of her cards.
- The player takes the first turn, and can hit or stay.
  -- If the player hits, she gets another card, and again has the opportunity to hit (get another card) or stay.
  -- If the player goes over 21 points, she busts.
  -- If the player stays, the dealer plays next.
- If the player didn't bust, it's now the dealer's turn.
  -- The dealer reveals his face-down card.
  -- If the dealer's total points are less than 17, he must hit and receive another card.
  -- If the dealer goes over 21 points, he busts.
  -- If the dealer has 17 points or more, he must stay.
- Results of the game are determined.
